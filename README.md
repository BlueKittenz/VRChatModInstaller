# VRChat Mod Manager

This program will install custom mods into VRChat automatically, and can be re-run in order to update the mods.

This installer is a forked version of [BeatSaberModInstaller](https://github.com/Umbranoxio/BeatSaberModInstaller) by Umbranoxio, modified to make it works with VRChat.
